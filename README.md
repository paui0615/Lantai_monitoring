# Introduction
## The project is a seismology real-time monitoring system at Lantai landslide area in Taiwan, Ilan. The system uses a seismic network to monitor environmental noise, microseismic activity and slope movement in landslide areas. Front-end and back-end separation is used to demonstrate the system. The back-end includes receiving real-time seismic wave signals, data pre-processing, scientific calculations and data transmission, mainly using python flask. The front end is responsible for receiving back-end data and web page display, mainly using React.js. However, due to security protocols, the website is not public and is owned by the Earth Structure Laboratory of the Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica. (hhhuang@earth.sinica.edu.tw)
